# Neighborhood Map
### A Map of Some Independent Music and Art Venues on the West Side of Cleveland

#### Project Description
This project integrates functionality from the Google Maps API
with the FourSquare API, data binding from within
KnockoutJS and stylistic elements from Bootstrap to create
a map of independent music venues on the West Side of Cleveland, Ohio.

The project allows for users to load locations and filter these
locations based on their categorization [Bar, Venue, Gallery].  
Upon clicking on the marker information about the venue and a link
to the venue's FourSquare page is displayed in the infowindow.
